# proximityphate
discovering the latent low-dimensional manifold in proximity labeling data via machine learning tools

PHATE is a tool from the Krishnaswamy lab at Yale:
Moon, van Dijk, Wang, Gigante et al. Visualizing Transitions and Structure for Biological Data Exploration. 2019. Nature Biotechnology.
The "PHATE practice" script is an example from this paper. 

the proximity 2D clustering model is adapted from this script, and also extends upon it, e.g. by making data points clickable for better visualization/ tracking
